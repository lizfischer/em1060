               			by five scribes (including the scribe who, according to <a href="#dra419">Drage 1978</a>,
               			worked very closely with <span class="name">Leofric</span>, bishop of Exeter 1050-72), all

                     <p>Some leaves might have been originally ruled for a different book: fols 18 and 21, for example, had a wider frame than other
                        leaves, but a vertical line was added so that the widths of written space would be unified with the rest of the leaves (see
                        <a href="../mss_layout/LO11_b.pdf">LO11_b</a>). Fols 24 and 31, on the other hand, seemed to have had only 26 lines originally, with another line added at the bottom (see

            Caroline or insular minuscule respectively' (<a href="#dra419">Drage 1978</a>, p. 337).
