         <h3 id="EM.BL.Harl.6258B-summary-1">Summary:</h3>
         <p> The manuscript includes material for the practice of medicine:
                        the Old English translation of <span class="italics">Pseudo-Apuleius Herbarius</span> and <span class="italics">Medicina de Quadrupedus</span>, which give, respectively, a list
                        of plants and animals together with their therapeutic qualities, and a collection of
                        remedies, the <span class="italics">Peri didaxeon</span>, that illustrates their use and their
                        effectiveness together with their therapeutic applications. Although the earlier foliation
                        suggests that the manuscript originally contained thirty more initial leaves, the
                        quire's medieval signatures run from 'I', indicate that the extant texts were intended as a
                        complete collection of medical treatises. Beccaria does not include this codex in his catalogue <span class="italics">I codici di medicina del periodo presalernitano</span>, because it is not pre-Salernitan, that is, before the eleventh century (<a href="#bec791">Beccaria 
                             1956</a>).

                     <p> BL Harley 6258B, unlike the other Old English versions, is shorter and arranges
                                        the herbs in alphabetical order according to their Latin names (considering the
                                        first letter only). Residues of the previous arrangement are witnessed in the text
                                        (see fol. 33v where the last two words coincide with the first two words of the
                                        following chapter according to the arrangement of the other versions). Nevertheless, all the witnesses descend,
                                        very probably, from a common ancestor (see <a href="#dev838"> De Vriend
                                           1984</a>, p. xliii).

                                   Old English provide a brief summary of the content of the remedies. It is unlikely
                                   they were copied from the Latin original (see <a href="#dev838">De Vriend
                                      1984</a>, pp. xxix-xxx), and it seems probable that they were added to allow quick
                                   retrieval of a specific cure in the text.

         <p class="totheright"><span class="itemHeading">Condition: </span> The manuscript is well-preserved on the whole; there are many holes (fols
                            25, 34, etc.) and tears (fols 6, 24, etc.), but they do not interfere with the
                            texts; certain tears have been sown up with string (e.g. fol. 10). The manuscript suffered
                            damage and was affected by several losses. Eight leaves (fols 11-19) are burnt
                            fragments: they have been recovered in the material belonging to the Cottonian
                            collection (see <a href="#coc404"> Cockayne 1866</a>, I, p. lxxxv) and gaps in
                            foliation indicate that several leaves are missing. The earliest foliation, running
                            from 31 in coincidence with the first folio of the manuscript, suggests the loss of thirty
                            leaves before the present contents. Furthermore, the numbering interruptions between
                            fols 38 (fol. 10) and 49 (fol. 19) and between fol. 49 and fol. 54 (fol. 20)
                            suggest that at least fourteen more leaves are lost and are only partly recovered by
                            the fragments. Finally, the catchword at the end of Quire 7 (fol. 66v) and the
                            abrupt interruption of the text, indicate that the manuscript contained at least one
                            more quire originally.

                                 <a href="#bec791">Beccaria 1956</a> does not include this codex in his
                                 catalogue because it is not pre-Salernitan (ante eleventh century).
            </p>
                          
                          
            <p><a href="#ker44">Ker 1957</a> described it as a 'small ill-formed script'
                               and dated it after 1200 on the
                               strength of the shape of the biting <span class="c">d</span> before <span class="c">e</span> and <span class="c">o</span>, the
                               <span class="c">tironian nota</span> with an horizontal stroke across its ascender and the 'small ill-formed'
                               nature of the script (p. xix). <a href="#dev838">De Vriend 1984</a>
                               discounted this suggestion arguing that the features Ker put forward are not
                               exclusively post-1200 features. He points out that there is an unmistakable
                               resemblance between this codex and <a href="EM.BL.Harl.55.htm">Harley
                                  55</a>, fols 5-13 (<span class="italics">Laws of Cnut</span>) dated mid-twelfth century
                               by Ker (see <a href="#ker44">Ker 1957</a>, no. 226): they show the same kind
                               of 'prickly' script although much neater and more regular in manuscript Harley 55.
                               Thus, De Vriend 
                               suggested dating the manuscript to the second half of the twelfth century at the
                               latest (p. xxx). <a href="#ang98">Doane 1994</a> defined it as
                               a pointed insular minuscule with some Caroline features (p. 44), while Laura Nuvolini, in a private communication,
               suggests calling it an English vernacular
                               minuscule with some protogothic features.
            </p>
                          
            <p>However, these discussions ought to consider that the manuscript could be written
                               before the thirteenth century, because of the confusion of the letters <span class="c">t</span> and
                                 <span class="c">j</span> (for instance on fol. 10r/2 <span class="c">m&#230;tan</span> is corrected in <span class="c">m&#230;jan</span>)
                               which is not attested after that time (see <a href="#bur830"> Burchfield
                                  1953</a>, pp. 8-17). Moreover, the similarities between <a href="EM.BL.Harl.55.htm">Harley 55</a> and <a href="EM.BL.Harl.6258B.htm">Harley 6258B</a> are not
                               relevant for dating as the letters <span class="c">s</span>, <span class="c">f</span> and <span class="c">r</span> are, in this first
                               manuscript, always of insular type, while the later uses Caroline forms. A late
                               twelfth-century dating seems more appropriate. Many Caroline forms are only slightly
                               compressed, the letters are still well-separated and a consistent use of protogothic
                               elements is lacking, thus suggesting a period not too close to the thirteenth
                               century. On the other hand, the development of serifs and feet points to a late
                               twelfth-century dating.

            <p> There is no decoration and brown ink, that varies from dark to light, is generally
                             used. Red colour occurs in some marginal annotations, that are sometimes framed in
                             brown or red, in the initials (they are accompanied by faint guide letters in margins)
                             that span two lines high, rarely three (fol. 2v/5), and in chapters and texts headings.
                             Red is often very faded and the letters are rewritten in brown ink. Brown majuscules
                             are used to mark the beginning of some chapters. Indexical letters run at the tops of
                             most of the folios, and occasionally besides the text, from A (fol. 1) to X (fol. 44),
                             corresponding to the alphabetical arrangement of the <span class="italics">Herbarius</span>

               <ul>
                                  
                  <li>The title "A Saxon Herball" that appears on fol. 1r has been identified with
                                       Thomas Cotton's hand (1594-1662) by C. Tite (information kindly provided by Laura
                                       Nuvoloni).

                  <li>The word <span class="italics">arthemisia</span> in the top margin of fol. 1r and <span class="italics">eganne dryb</span> (eye drop?) on the right margin of fol. 10r seem of
                                       the same seventeenth-century hand. 
                  </li>
                  
                                  
                  <li>The other additions consist of curatorial interventions. Stamping: the
                                       ownership of the manuscript by the British nation is proclaimed by the insertion
                                       of bright red stamps throughout. Usually at the beginning and end of the
                                       manuscript (see <a href="#pre408"> Prescott 2006</a>, p. 473), here on the
                                       fifth front flyleaf and fol. 65v probably because the first and last folios are
                                       darker than the rest and the stamp would be hardly visible, are large square red
                                       stamps, reading 'MUSEUM BRITANNICUM' and dated to the eighteenth century. A smaller
                                       stamp with the words 'BRITISH MUSEUM' around a small crown, is placed in the
                                       margins throughout the manuscript (e.g. fols 8v, 26v, 32v). Notes on allocation
                                       on the top margin of fol. 1r the Harley shelfmarks '6258.b.' in dark brown ink and
                                       '2/III A' in pencil, the latter being also found on the endleaf of Harley 585,
                                       another medical manuscript because Harleian manuscripts were shelved according to subject
                                       classification in Montagu House. On the back of front cover, low left corner,
                                       '49.9.' is written in pencil.
                  </li>
                                  
                  <li><a href="#dev838">De Vriend</a> (1984, p. 62) suggests a later hand for
                                       the addition to <span class="italics">torenijen </span> in the top margin of fol. 36r. The
                                       hand seems, however, the same but varies slightly in being a little less
                                       compressed, as in the annotation of the lower margin of fol. 32r.

                  <li>The title of fol. 20r <span class="italics">millefolio</span> added in the top margin is
                                       very similar to the main hand, but the colour is very black and <span class="italics">millefolio</span> is added in the middle of the ninth cure of the chapter, thus
                                       suggesting that it may have been added later, perhaps after the loss of Quire 2
                                       which contains the beginning of the chapter.

            <p> Outside leaves, front and back, are darker than the rest, suggesting that the
                             manuscript was unbound for a long period. It has then been bound at least
                             three times.

            <p><a href="#coc404">Cockayne</a> (1866, I, p. lxxxv) mentioned the substitution of
                             an earlier binding just after his publication of the manuscript, in 1866. The
                             nineteenth-century binding is described as a small volume bound in brown leather; on
                             the front and back covers, the coats of arms of the Harley family, gold-tooled; on the
                             spine the title 'DE MEDICINIS HERBARIUM DE FERIS MEDICAMENTIS ETC. ANGLICE, MUS. BRIT.

                             moving of the manuscripts from Montagu House into the Manuscripts Saloon in 1824 (see
                               <a href="#pre408">Prescott 2006</a>, p. 513).
