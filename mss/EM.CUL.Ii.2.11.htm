        Summary:
      </h3>
      <p>
        The West-Saxon translation of the <span class="italics">Four Gospels</span>, <span class="italics">Gospel of Nicodemus</span> and <span class="italics">Vindicta Salvatoris</span> copied in s. xi<span class="sup">3/4</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The manuscript originally contained a preliminary quire (quire 1), and its final quire (quire 27) had several blank pages. The preliminary quire and the blank pages of quire 27 were filled with a copy of the list of Leofric's gifts, his inscriptions and a series of legal documents in s. xi<span class="sup">3/4</span>-xii<span class="sup">1</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Five leaves from the preliminary quire and three leaves from the end of the manuscript were cut and bound at the beginning of the <span class="italics">Exeter Book</span> (Exeter Cathedral, 3501) before the sixteenth century. The first leaf is not foliated, and the rest are foliated as fols 1-7.
      </p>

        The manuscript items shown below are arranged in the order in which we assume to have been <a href="#OriginalStructure1">the original order</a>, i.e. before the leaves were cut.

              Hand 4 later added three items interlinearly in order to update the list. These additions are also found in <a href="EM.Ox.Auct.D.2.16.htm">Auct.

              Later hands also corrected the text in order to update the list. See the following items (Items <a href="#EM.CUL.Ii.2.11-msItem-4">4</a> and <a href="#EM.CUL.Ii.2.11-msItem-5">5</a>).

              <span class="itemHeading">Decoration</span>: Part of the two-line high decorative letter seems to have been hidden when this leaf was strengthened using a strip of vellum. A later hand re-drew the letter 'H' in black ink. Now the strip of vellum is removed and bound in the <span class="italics">Exeter Book</span> separately, and the trace of the letter 'H' is visible on the vellum.

              The gospels are divided into a larger number of chapters than in other copies. Chapters are usually preceded by headings in red, which indicate the occasion on which each passage should be read, and the Latin Incipits in black ink. For example (fol. 5v, Matthew, 4:1):
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              sunu on Ã¾am me gelicode. <span class="red">Ãis godspel sceal</span> |<br>

              <span class="deco"><span class="green">Ã</span></span>a wÃ¦s se hÃ¦lend gelÃ¦d
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              The Gospel of Matthew is divided into 102 chapters. The beginning of the Book does not have the Latin Incipit, nor the English heading, which indicate the occasion on which the first passage should be read. The text finishes on fol. 54r/13, and the rest of fol. 54r and fol. 54v are left blank.

            <li>CUL fol. 1 is now a singleton, with the s. xi<span class="sup">2</span> inscriptions written down and the book's seal attached on the recto side, which was originally verso.

Quire 21 (fols 152-59) has a pair of half-sheets too: fols 154 and 157; the second outer sheet of Quire 21 (fols 153 and 58) originally had holes on it, and was stitched.
            </li>
            <li>Quire 27 (fols 200-202): now three singletons. Part of fol. 202 was cut out, and bound in the <span class="italics">Exeter Book</span>, and the remain of this leaf is repaired with a modern parchment. Stubs of fols 200 and 202 (which is the repaired parchment) are visible in the following order: stub of 202, 200, 201, stub of 200.

            <li>CUL fol. 1 must have been a singleton by 1566, with the s. xi<span class="sup">2</span> inscriptions written down on the verso side (which is now recto). As the CUL shelf mark no, 'Ii-2-11' is written on the left inner margin of the page with inscriptions, and as it would have been more natural for the shelf mark not to be written in the inner margin, this leaf was probably bound correctly with the blank page as its recto. The library book seal was often pasted on the pastedown of the upper cover (see for example, <a href="EM.CUL.Ii.2.4.htm">CUL Ii. 2. 4</a>, or <a href="EM.CUL.Hh.1.10.htm">Hh. 1. 10</a>), but in the case of CUL.

                The structure of the original Quire 1 can be reconstructed from the shape and size of wormholes. According to <a href="#ker44">Ker 1957</a>, three wormholes near the bottom of the fol. 1 (the folio with inscription) do not recur on the paper leaves (the original pastedown and flyleaves), but correspond, if the leaf is reversed, to holes in Exeter fols 0 (now upside down), 1-3, and 7 and the holes in CUL fols 2 and 3. The size of the holes, as compared with those on the other leaves, shows that CUL fol. 1 came between Exeter fol. 0 and CUL fol. 2. The holes on Exeter fol. 7 are larger than on other leaves, so that this leaf must have preceded the others.

This scribe tended to avoid a widow by putting the last word of a sentence outside the usual written space at the end of a page and enclosing the word by drawling lines to its left-hand side and its bottom at fols 42r, 56r, 66v, 67r, 102r, and so on. At fol. 136r, the final two lines are longer than usual, and there is an extra line outside the usual writing space, so that John 2 starts at the top of fol. 136v. At Mark 1:29, fols 56r/13, the scribe intended to add the Latin incipit in one line, but it did not fit. He put the final two words next to lines 14 and 15.

        Decoration Description:
      </h4>
      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <p>
          The four gospel books all start with a blue large initial letter, and are subdivided into smaller sections. The colours of the decorative initial letters which indicate beginnings of sections then alternate in a very regular pattern: Blue-Red, Green-Red, Blue-Red, Green-Red with only a few exceptions such as: fols 13r-13v: Red-Red; fols 19r-20r: Blue-Red-Blue; fols 53r-54r: Green-Red-Green. The red ink is often metallic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the letters in red have turned into metallic silver, probably due to oxidisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chapters are usually preceded by a heading and rubric in the same hand and script of the texts. The heading, rubric and the decorative letters were probably added to the text later. For example, at fol. 12r/11 or fol. 31v/7, the English heading did not fit within the space before the section division, and thus part of the final word was written in the right margin. There are also places where white space was left before the new chapter, but neither the English heading nor the Latin Incipit was added: for example fols 32r, 34r, 61v, 66r, 94v, 95v, 121v, 122v, and so forth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scribe sometimes wrote the English rubric at the chapter divisions in two lines towards the right, so that the rubric fits nicely. For example, <span class="locus">CUL fol. 86v/8-11</span> (Luke, 1:39):
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          dryhtnes Ã¾ynen. ge Æ¿eorÃ°e me Ã¦ft<span class="expanded">er</span> Ã¾inu<span class="expanded">m</span> Æ¿orde. Ë¥ se |<br>
          engel hyre fra<span class="expanded">m</span> geÆ¿at Â·<span class="red">Ãis gebyraÃ° on frigedÃ¦g to</span> |<br>
          Exsurgens aute<span class="expanded">m</span> maria Â· <span class="red">to Ã¾a<span class="expanded">m</span> ylcan fÃ¦stene</span> |<br>
          <span class="deco"><span class="green">S</span></span>oÃ°lice onÃ¾a<span class="expanded">m</span> dagu<span class="expanded">m</span> aras maria Ë¥ ferde on munt land |<br>
          myd ofste.
        </blockquote>The previous section finishes with 'hyre fra<span class="expanded">m</span> geÆ¿at Â·', the new section starts with '<span class="deco">S</span>oÃ°lice onÃ¾a<span class="expanded">m</span>', and one and a half lines of space were left for the direction in English and the Latin Incipit. The scribe wrote the rubric in English towards the right, and started the new line with the Latin Incipit, 'Exsurgens aute<span class="expanded">m</span> maria Â·'. Similar examples can be seen on fols 97r and 99v.
        <p>
          <span class="italics">Gospel of Nicodemus</span> (fol. 173v) and <span class="italics">Vindicta Salvatoris</span> (fol. 193r) begin with a large green initial letter, and they do not have subdivisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scribe tried to avoid a widow at page divisions and chapter divisions. For example, at fol. 121r/3-5 (Luke 19:29):
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          hierusale<span class="expanded">m</span>. <span class="red">Ãys gebyraÃ° feoÆ¿er Æ¿ucon Ã¦r middan</span> |<br>
          <span class="red">Æ¿yntra Ë¥ on palm sunnan dÃ¦g.</span> ã bethfagie. |<br>
          Cu<span class="expanded">m</span> adp<span class="expanded">po</span>pinquasset iÉ§s hierosolimis et uenisset |<br>
          <span class="deco"><span class="red">Ã¾</span></span>a he ge nealÃ¦hte bethfage Ë¥ bebethania to Ã¾a<span class="expanded">m</span> |<br>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The Latin Incipit has one word 'bethfagie', which did not fit in line 5, and so was inserted at the end of line 4. The upper and left sides of the word 'bethfagie' are enclosed with lines which mark that the word belongs to the next line.
        </p>

        Binding Description:
      </h4>
      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <p>
          The current binding is dark brown leather, rebound in <span class="date_key">1940</span> at Cambridge University Library (the date is given on the pastedown of the upper cover of the current binding). Flyleaves fols i, ii, and 213 and 214 were added then. On the spine of the book, the title <span class="italics">QVATVOR EVANGELIA</span> and the manuscript number 'Ii. 2. 11' are given in gold.
        </p>
        <p>
          The previous binding, an elaborately tooled one made for <span class="name">Archbishop Parker</span> in <span class="date_key">1566</span>, is now kept separately. The leather is light brown, stamped in gold. The binding boards have the remains of two clasps, and the outer corners are covered with strips of metal. The board of the binding is about 6 mm thick, 224 mm x 334 mm. The horn label on the lower cover is inscribed <span class="italics">Evangelia 4<span class="sup">or</span> saxon.</span>, and the hand of this inscription is the same as the hand of inscription on the horn label of Ii. 2.11. The pastedown and the flyleaf of the upper cover were removed from the cover, and are now bound with the rest of the book as fols ix and x. They are from the sixteenth-century accounts: a vellum (fols ix<span class="sup">r</span>-x<span class="sup">v</span>) and a paper (fols ix<span class="sup">v</span>-x<span class="sup">r</span>) are pasted together.
        </p>
        <p>
          The flyleaf of the lower cover of the previous binding is now kept with the old binding. The pastedown of the lower cover is still attached to the cover.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seal of the Cambridge University Library is attached on <a href="../surrogates/CUL/Ii.2.11_fol.1r.htm">fol. 1r</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the five leaves from the preliminary quire and three leaves from Quire 27 were cut and bound at the beginning of the <span class="italics">Exeter Book</span> before the sixteenth century, some of the leaves were fastened together with strips of a fifteenth-century account-roll (See <span class="italics">Exeter Book</span>, pp. 93-94). Three sets of leaves fastened together were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Exeter now fols 6 and 7 (originally Quire 27, fol. 5 and Preliminary Quire, fol. 1)
          </li>
          <li>Exeter now fols 0 and 5 (originally Preliminary Quire, fol. 5 and Quire 27, fol. 3)
          </li>
          <li>Exeter now fols 1 and 4 (originally Preliminary Quire, fol. 2 and Quire 27, fol. 4)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Whoever fastened these leaves together probably did not know anything about the original make-up of the CUL Ii. 2. 11. The current Exeter fol. 1 contains <a href="#EM.CUL.Ii.2.11-msItem-3">Item 3</a>. Part of the two-line high decorative letter has been hidden under the split of parchment. A later hand re-drew the letter 'H' in black ink.
        </p>
        <p>
          These three strips of vellum have now been removed from these leaves, and bound separately in the <span class="italics">Exeter Book</span>.
