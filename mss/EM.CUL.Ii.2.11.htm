            <p>The manuscript originally contained a preliminary quire (quire 1), and its final quire (quire 27) had
                       several blank pages. The preliminary quire and the blank pages of quire 27 were filled with
                       a copy of the list of Leofric's gifts, his inscriptions and a series of legal documents in s. xi<span class="sup">3/4</span>-xii<span class="sup">1</span>. 
            </p>
                
            <p>Five leaves from the preliminary quire and three leaves from the end
                       of the manuscript were cut and bound at the beginning of the <span class="italics">Exeter

                     	      The first correction was presumably overwritten on 'liber Prudentii de matyribus', which had been erased, because three works of Prudentius which were mentioned in the original list as three different items
                     later on became bound up into one volume. The second correction here was overwritten on 'and diadema monachorum', which presumably had gone missing in the library.

                     <li>Current CUL fol. ix was the pastedown, and fol. x was the flyleaf. They are from the
                        	    sixteenth-century accounts: 
                        		one parchment (ix<span class="sup">r</span>-x<span class="sup">v</span>) 
                        		and one paper (ix<span class="sup">v</span>-x<span class="sup">r</span>) are pasted together.

                     <li>CUL fol. 1 must have been a singleton by 1566, with the s. xi<span class="sup">2</span> inscriptions written down on the verso side (which is now recto). As the CUL shelf mark no, 'Ii-2-11' is written on the left inner margin of the page with inscriptions, and as it would have been more natural for the shelf mark
                        not to be written in the inner margin, this leaf was probably bound correctly with the blank page as its recto. The library
                        book seal was often pasted on the pastedown of the upper cover (see for example, 
                        	    <a href="EM.CUL.Ii.2.4.htm">CUL Ii. 2. 4</a>, or <a href="EM.CUL.Hh.1.10.htm">Hh. 1. 10</a>), but in the case of CUL. Ii. 2.11, we can assume that it was pasted on the verso side of this leaf, as there was no space
                        on the pastedown.

            Corrections and alterations appear consistently from the beginning to the end. Methods of cancellation include physical erasure
            of letters by scratching off the surface of the parchment and underlining. Methods of addition include overwriting letters
            on the top of erasure, interlinear additions with or without caret mark, and additions in the margin. Many by the main scribe,
            but some of them were by later hands.

                      <span class="name">Exeter</span> scriptorium of s. xi<span class="sup">2</span>. Latin and Old
                      English scripts are usually distinguished. This scribe tended to avoid a widow by putting the
                      last word of a sentence outside the usual written space at the end of a page and enclosing the
                      word by drawling lines to its left-hand side and its bottom at fols 42r, 56r, 66v, 67r, 102r,
                      and so on. At fol. 136r, the final two lines are longer than usual, and there is an extra line
                      outside the usual writing space, so that John 2 starts at the top of fol. 136v.
                  
                  At Mark 1:29, fols 56r/13, the scribe intended to add the Latin incipit in one line, but it did not
                  fit. He put the final two words next to lines 14 and 15.

               the decorative initial letters which indicate beginnings of sections then alternate in a very regular pattern: Blue-Red, Green-Red,
               Blue-Red, Green-Red with only a few exceptions such as: fols 13r-13v: Red-Red; fols 19r-20r: Blue-Red-Blue; fols 53r-54r:
               Green-Red-Green. The red ink is often metallic.

               decorative letters were probably added to the text later. For example, at fol. 12r/11 or fol. 31v/7, the English heading did
               not fit within the space before the section division, and thus part of the final word was written in the right margin. There
               are also places where white space was left before the new chapter, but neither the English heading nor the Latin Incipit was
               added: for example fols 32r, 34r, 61v, 66r, 94v, 95v, 121v, 122v, and so forth.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               The scribe sometimes wrote the English rubric at the chapter divisions in two lines towards the right, so that the rubric
               fits nicely. For example, <span class="locus">CUL fol. 86v/8-11</span> (Luke, 1:39):
               
               	
               <blockquote>

               The previous section finishes with 'hyre fra<span class="expanded">m</span> ge&#447;at &#183;', the new section starts with '<span class="deco">S</span>o&#240;lice on&#254;a<span class="expanded">m</span>', and one and a half lines of space were left for the direction in English and the Latin Incipit. The scribe wrote the rubric
               in English towards the right, and started the new line with the Latin Incipit, 'Exsurgens aute<span class="expanded">m</span> maria &#183;'. Similar examples can be seen on fols 97r and 99v.

            <p>The current binding is dark brown leather, rebound in  <span class="date_key">1940</span> at Cambridge University Library (the date is given on the pastedown of the upper cover of the current binding). Flyleaves
               fols i, ii, and 213 and 214 were added then. On the spine of the book, the title <span class="italics">QVATVOR EVANGELIA</span> and the manuscript number 'Ii. 2. 11' are given in gold.
                                       	
                                       
            </p>
                                    
                                    
            <p>
               The previous binding, an elaborately tooled one made for <span class="name">Archbishop Parker</span> in <span class="date_key">1566</span>, is now kept separately.
               
               The leather is light brown, stamped in gold.
               
               The binding boards have the remains of two clasps, and the outer corners are covered with strips of metal.
               The board of the binding is about 6 mm thick, 224 mm x 334 mm.
               
               The horn label on the lower cover is inscribed <span class="italics">Evangelia 4<span class="sup">or</span> saxon.</span>, and the hand of this inscription is the same as the hand of inscription on the horn label of Ii. 2.11.
               
               The pastedown and the flyleaf of the upper cover were removed from the cover, and are now bound with
               the rest of the book as fols ix and x. They are from the sixteenth-century accounts: a vellum (fols ix<span class="sup">r</span>-x<span class="sup">v</span>) and a paper (fols ix<span class="sup">v</span>-x<span class="sup">r</span>) are pasted together.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The flyleaf of the lower cover of the previous binding is now kept with the old binding. The pastedown of the lower cover
               is still attached to the cover.
            </p>
            	
            
            <p>
               The seal of the Cambridge University Library is attached on <a href="../surrogates/CUL/Ii.2.11_fol.1r.htm">fol. 1r</a>.

               When the five leaves from the preliminary quire and three leaves from Quire 27 were cut and bound at
               the beginning of the <span class="italics">Exeter Book</span> before the sixteenth century, some of the leaves were fastened together with strips of a fifteenth-century account-roll (See
               <span class="italics">Exeter Book</span>, pp. 93-94). Three sets of leaves fastened together were:
               	
               <ul>
                  		
                  <li>Exeter now fols 6 and 7 (originally Quire 27, fol. 5 and Preliminary Quire, fol. 1)</li>
                  		
                  <li>Exeter now fols 0 and 5 (originally Preliminary Quire, fol. 5 and Quire 27, fol. 3)</li>
                  		
                  <li>Exeter now fols 1 and 4 (originally Preliminary Quire, fol. 2 and Quire 27, fol. 4)</li>

            <p>
               Whoever fastened these leaves together probably did not know anything about the original make-up of the CUL Ii. 2. 11. The
               current Exeter fol. 1 contains <a href="#EM.CUL.Ii.2.11-msItem-3">Item 3</a>. Part of the two-line high decorative letter has been hidden under the split of parchment. A later hand re-drew the letter
