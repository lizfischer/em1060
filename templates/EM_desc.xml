	We consider any texts, i.e., main text, marginalia, annotations, corrections, additions etc. included before 1220 as 'items'.
	Other Items added AFTER 1220 are defined as 'additions', and they will be included under
	"physDesc/additions". See below.
-->

	
<msItem n="xxxx" defective="xxxx" class="main">
	<!-- @n: NOT mandatory. All the Manuscript Items will be automatically numbered.
		It is however useful to number the items according to the kinds of text.
		In the case of CUL.Ii.2.11, there are only 6 main items, but there are numerous supplementary items, and 
		some of them are bound in Exeter Book. For the purpose of clarity and convenience, we numbered 
		the main items with just numbers. Items appear in the Exeter with a prefix of "Exeter_", and so on. -->

	      IF the manuscript is defective, then also explain the defectiveness in prose below, in <note type="main"></note>
	-->
      <!-- @class identifies the text types or classifications applicable to this object. 
               Class which will be defined are:  
               main  = text in the main frame or column
               marginalia  = text in any margin
               interlineata  = text in interlinear position
               toc = table of content
              
               We include as an "item" any alteration performed on the text which has been added in the margin, interlinearly etc. and therefore the class to be used will follow the POSITION, 
               rather than the type of text, i.e. gloss, commentary, note, alteration. This item, however, 
               will have to have been inserted during the temporal termini of the project 1060 to 1220,

		as our "uniform' title. For example:
		<title type="uniform>Ælfric, <hi rend="title">First Series of Homilies [Catholic Homilies I]</hi>,
		'English Preface'</title>
	
	The @xml:id allows us to collate the information at a later stage, so that the users can search all the manuscripts 
	which contain a particular item. We use Cameron's designations for our ID numbers. 
	For example, in Cameron, the above item is under:
		B. Prose; 1. Ælfric; 1.1 First Series of Homilies [Catholic Homilies I]; 1.1.1: English Preface

	Hence, the xml:id number will be:
		B.1.1.1

		-a
		-b
		-c
	in addition to the ID number, for example:
		<title type="uniform" xml:lang="en" xml:id="B.16.10.6-c">Manumissions</title>
		  
	
	 If no uniform title is listed in Cameron for an item, and if one wishes to provide a general designation of the contents, 
	then a 'supplied' title can be given. If you supply a title in this way, do NOT give an 'xml:id' number.   -->
