Hollie is completing her MA in English Literary Research at the University of Leicester, currently writing a dissertation on London, College of Arms, Arundel 58 under the supervision of Dr. Orietta Da Rold. She is soon to start a PhD at York Centre for Medieval Studies, looking at beds and bedchambers in Middle English Romance. She is particularly interested in the relationship between material and textual cultures.

 

 

 

(I was going to say 'Bookish twenty-something seeks Arthurian knight for romance and jousting. Must have own library, noble steed and chivalric code. Pentangles optional.', but this is not the Camelot lonely hearts column)
