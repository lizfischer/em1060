Suggestions have been made that the Psalter may have been a bespoke manuscript written or decorated by professionals to be sent abroad (<a href=\"#can223\">Dodwell</a> 1954, pp. 98-100 and pp. 22-23; <a href=\"#gib175\">Gibson et al.</a> 1992, p. 190).",

The recent history of the manuscript is quite well documented. The book was then present in the library of <span class=\"name\">Margaret of Austria</span> (1480-1530, regent of the Netherlands), and it appears in inventories of Margaret's library from 1516 and 1523. In an inventory of 1565, the book went to her niece, <span class=\"name\">Marie of Hungary</span> (1505-1559), whose <span class=\"italics\">ex libris</span> plate was found in the previous binding. At Marie's death (1559), the manuscript was inventoried in 1615-1617 for <span class=\"name\">Archdukes Albert</span> (1559-1621) and <span class=\"name\">Isabella</span> (1566-1633) in the <span class=\"name\">Library of Burgundy</span> in <span class=\"name\">Brussels</span>. In 1794, the manuscript was transferred from Brussels to Paris, entering into the <span class=\"name\">Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale</span> from the library of <span class=\"name\">Napoleon I</span> (1769-1821) (<a href=\"#gib175\">Gibson et al.</a> 1992, p. 190; <a href=\"#scl1004\">Sclafer et al.</a> 1997; <a href=\"#pul1489\">Pulsiano and Hussey</a> 2008, p. 114)"
