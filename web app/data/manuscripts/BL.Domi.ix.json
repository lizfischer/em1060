    "summary": "A collection of fragments comprising 19 items, of which the following are in English: Item 2, fol. 9: one leaf from a <span class=\"italics\">Chronicle</span> beginning with: the annal for 1113 'sÆ¿a Ã¾Ã¦t hig uneaÃ°e' (opening fol. 9v) and ending with the annal for 1114 'on rofecestre' (<a href=\"#zup960\">Zupitza</a> 1878, p. 195; <a href=\"#plu626\">Plummer</a> 1952, p. 243). <a href=\"#ker44\">Ker</a> notes that the differences in colour of ink and in writing, and the change of ink during the 1114 annal at 'Her Ã¦fter he ferde', would suggest that these are 'contemporary entries written up at short intervals' (<a href=\"#ker44\">Ker</a> 1957, p. 188). Item 4, fol. 11: one surviving leaf from the end of a manuscript which has not yet been identified. The recto contains three extracts from the translation of Bede's <span class=\"italics\">Historia ecclesiastica</span> (s. x<span class=\"sup\">in</span>). The verso contains thirty-five runic letters with transliteration and name of each rune in Anglo-Saxon script. The runes appear in three lines, the last of which comprises six runes in the tenth-century hand; according to <a href=\"#ker44\">Ker</a> (1957, p. 189) the others were probably added in s. xi/xii. Each line of runes has underneath it two more lines: one giving the Anglo-Saxon script value of each rune, and a second giving the rune names in Old English. <a href=\"#bat1193\">Bateley</a> (1992, p. 38) notes that some of the runes are partly covered by Talbot's annotations.",
