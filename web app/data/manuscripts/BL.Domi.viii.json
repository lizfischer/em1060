It comprises 10 items (see the excellent full descriptions in the <a href=\"#bri1165\">British Library Catalogue</a> and <a href=\"#dum1480\">Dumville</a> 1995, pp. 11-13). Item 3, fols 30-70, contains the <span class=\"italics\">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> (F-text), which begins 'Britene igland ys ehta hund mila [lang]' and ends at the bottom of fol. 70v in the annal for 1058 '7 Siward abbod to biscope to ro[feceastre]' (see, <a href=\"#bak1502\">Baker</a> 2000). Each annal is followed by a Latin version. There are additions in the margin, between the lines, on erasure, and on a small inserted leaf (fol. 60). These are followed by Latin versions. Some additions relate to <span class=\"name\">Kentish affairs</span> and especially to <span class=\"name\">Christ Church</span> and the archbishops. Some entries are textually almost identical to additions to the Parker Chronicle made at Christ Church. There are a few additions in Latin in a hand of s. xi/xii (<a href=\"#ker44\">Ker</a> 1957, p. 187) on fols 35v 36r/v, 38v; this hand is 'similar in style to the Norman hands found in several writs of this period' (<a href=\"#bak1502\">Baker</a> 2000, pp. xxiii-xxiv).",

Fols 54-70 number of pricks on the outer margin increases up to 40-45 lines per folio (see also <a href=\"#bak1502\">Baker</a> 2000, p. xxiv-xxvii). Ruling very faint, except on fols 69, 70. Fols 30 and 70v look dark brownish, possibly from exposure as though these quires were not been bound for a time (<a href=\"#ker44\">Ker</a> 1957, p. 187). <a href=\"#bak1502\">Baker</a> (2000, p. xvi) notes that 'the clearly visible brush-strokes on these pages suggest they at one time served as paste-down'. Considering that reagents were applied to the margins and folios of the manuscript, it is also possible that the brush-strokes related to this practice rather than to the application of glue to these external folios."
