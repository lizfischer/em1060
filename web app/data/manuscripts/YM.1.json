    "history": {
        "origin": "According to <a href=\"#doa788\">Doane</a> the manuscript was probably produced at <span class=\"name\">Christ Church, Canterbury</span>, as fol. 23v was executed in the known hand of the Christ Church scribe <span class=\"name\">Eadui Basan</span> (1012-1020s), though <span class=\"name\">St. Augustine's</span> is a possibility (2007, p. 135).", 
        "provenance": "The manuscript was at <span class=\"name\">York</span> in s. xi<span class=\"sup\">1</span>, as can be seen from the Old English surveys of three Yorkshire estates. Because the manuscript survived the fire of 1069, <a href=\"#nor985\">Norton</a> 2004 argues that the book was not kept at the Minster but at the estate of the York archbishops at <span class=\"name\">Sherburn-in-Elmet</span>, mentioned in the surveys. York-related documents continued to be recorded until the late sixteenth-century, and was used as an oath-book for the chapter, s. xiii-xv.", 
        "acquisition": "During the period of the Civil Wars or Commonwealth the Gospels appear to have left <span class=\"name\">York</span>, because in 1678 they were returned by the executors of the will of <span class=\"name\">Henry King, Bishop of Chichester</span>, who had died nine years earlier (Barr in <a href=\"#ale591\">Alexander et al</a> 1986, pp. 11-12)."
