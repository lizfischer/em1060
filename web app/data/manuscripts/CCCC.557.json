It was found in 1936 and reported by <span class=\"name\">Ker</span> in 1940. Both books are from the <span class=\"name\">library of <span class=\"name\">Archbishop Parker</span></span>, with 16th-century Parkerian bindings, and were given to <span class=\"name\">Corpus Christi College</span> in 1575 (<a href=\"#ang86\">Doane 2002</a>, p. 1)."
