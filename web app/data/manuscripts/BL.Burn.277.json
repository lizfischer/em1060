The bifolium must have been detached from its original codex and used as a wrapper. <a href=\"#ker44\">Ker</a> (1957) notes that this probably happened in or before s. xiii, and refers to the Latin marginal notes and pen trials of this date. The area in the centre of the vertical fold in the bifolium will have formed the spine of the wrapper, and here there are traces of large upper-case letters, presumably from a title for the wrapper. Now only an upper-case <span class=\"c\">S</span> is clearly legible."
