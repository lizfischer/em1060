Thott 143 by different artists with access to the same models.", 
        "provenance": "Previously known as <span class=\"italics\">The York Psalter</span>. As there are a number of Northern saints' days marked in the calendar, it has been traditionally ascribed a Northern provenance. The presence of <span class=\"name\">John of Beverley</span> (Archbishop of <span class=\"name\">York</span>, d. 721) and <span class=\"name\">Paulinus</span> (Bishop of <span class=\"name\">York</span>, d. 644) in the Litany supports this argument. <a href=\"#gre1024\">Greenland</a> (1997) argues that the manuscript was possibly made for <span class=\"name\">Roger de Mowbray</span> (d. 1188), a <span class=\"name\">Yorkshire</span> magnate who founded over thirty mainly Augustinian and Cistercian monasteries and nunneries.", 
        "acquisition": "<span class=\"name\">Hunter</span> acquired the manuscript at the sale of the <span class=\"name\">library of Louis-Jean Gaignat</span> in <span class=\"name\">Paris</span>, 10th April 1769. His French agent, <span class=\"name\">Jean B. Dessain</span>, bought it for fifty livres and one sou. It was acquired by the <span class=\"name\">University of Glasgow</span> in 1807 with the rest of the <span class=\"name\">Hunter</span> library (<a href=\"#gar1048\">Gardham</a> 2007)."
