Although the earlier foliation suggests that the manuscript originally contained thirty more initial leaves, the quire's medieval signatures run from 'I', indicate that the extant texts were intended as a complete collection of medical treatises. Beccaria does not include this codex in his catalogue <span class=\"italics\">I codici di medicina del periodo presalernitano</span>, because it is not pre-Salernitan, that is, before the eleventh century (<a href=\"#bec791\">Beccaria 1956</a>).",

        "summary":"Although the script is very irregular and untidy and the hand varies over the course of its campaign, it seems that only one scribe was responsible for the transcription, corrections, additions of titles, initials and marginal annotations.\n\nThe manuscript is not described in Wanley's <span class=\"italics\"><a href=\"#wan470\">Catalogues</a></span> while the <span class=\"italics\"><a href=\"#cat829\">Catalogue of Harleian Manuscripts</a></span> (1973, iii, p. 347) merely states that the manuscript is evidently very old. <a href=\"#bec791\">Beccaria 1956</a> does not include this codex in his catalogue because it is not pre-Salernitan (ante eleventh century).\n\n<a href=\"#ker44\">Ker 1957</a> described it as a 'small ill-formed script' and dated it after 1200 on the strength of the shape of the biting <span class=\"c\">d</span> before <span class=\"c\">e</span> and <span class=\"c\">o</span>, the <span class=\"c\">tironian nota</span> with an horizontal stroke across its ascender and the 'small ill-formed' nature of the script (p. xix). <a href=\"#dev838\">De Vriend 1984</a> discounted this suggestion arguing that the features Ker put forward are not exclusively post-1200 features. He points out that there is an unmistakable resemblance between this codex and <a href=\"EM.BL.Harl.55.htm\">Harley 55</a>, fols 5-13 (<span class=\"italics\">Laws of Cnut</span>) dated mid-twelfth century by Ker (see <a href=\"#ker44\">Ker 1957</a>, no. 226): they show the same kind of 'prickly' script although much neater and more regular in manuscript Harley 55. Thus, De Vriend suggested dating the manuscript to the second half of the twelfth century at the latest (p. xxx). <a href=\"#ang98\">Doane 1994</a> defined it as a pointed insular minuscule with some Caroline features (p. 44), while Laura Nuvolini, in a private communication, suggests calling it an English vernacular minuscule with some protogothic features.\n\nHowever, these discussions ought to consider that the manuscript could be written before the thirteenth century, because of the confusion of the letters <span class=\"c\">t</span> and <span class=\"c\">j</span> (for instance on fol. 10r/2 <span class=\"c\">mÃ¦tan</span> is corrected in <span class=\"c\">mÃ¦jan</span>) which is not attested after that time (see <a href=\"#bur830\">Burchfield 1953</a>, pp. 8-17). Moreover, the similarities between <a href=\"EM.BL.Harl.55.htm\">Harley 55</a> and <a href=\"EM.BL.Harl.6258B.htm\">Harley 6258B</a> are not relevant for dating as the letters <span class=\"c\">s</span>, <span class=\"c\">f</span> and <span class=\"c\">r</span> are, in this first manuscript, always of insular type, while the later uses Caroline forms. A late twelfth-century dating seems more appropriate. Many Caroline forms are only slightly compressed, the letters are still well-separated and a consistent use of protogothic elements is lacking, thus suggesting a period not too close to the thirteenth century. On the other hand, the development of serifs and feet points to a late twelfth-century dating.",

                "correction": "corrections were carefully made by underdotting (fol. 45r/13), staining (fol. 49v/14) or underlining the letters to be deleted (fol. 44v/5), striking-through a word (fol. 45v/6); the correct word or letter may be interlined above (fol. 47v/18) or a signe-de-renvoi consisting of parallel slanting lines (fol. 10r/26) or a cross (fol. 10r/27) may be added. The parallel slanting lines are also used to indicate inversion of order (fol. 59r/18)."

    "decoration": ["There is no decoration and brown ink, that varies from dark to light, is generally used. Red colour occurs in some marginal annotations, that are sometimes framed in brown or red, in the initials (they are accompanied by faint guide letters in margins) that span two lines high, rarely three (fol. 2v/5), and in chapters and texts headings. Red is often very faded and the letters are rewritten in brown ink. Brown majuscules are used to mark the beginning of some chapters. Indexical letters run at the tops of most of the folios, and occasionally besides the text, from A (fol. 1) to X (fol. 44), corresponding to the alphabetical arrangement of the <span class=\"italics\">Herbarius</span> in this manuscript."],
    "additions": "There are only few later additions.\n\nThe title \"A Saxon Herball\" that appears on fol. 1r has been identified with Thomas Cotton's hand (1594-1662) by C. Tite (information kindly provided by Laura Nuvoloni).\n\nThe word <span class=\"italics\">arthemisia</span> in the top margin of fol. 1r and <span class=\"italics\">eganne dryb</span> (eye drop?) on the right margin of fol. 10r seem of the same seventeenth-century hand.\n\nThe other additions consist of curatorial interventions. Stamping: the ownership of the manuscript by the British nation is proclaimed by the insertion of bright red stamps throughout. Usually at the beginning and end of the manuscript (see <a href=\"#pre408\">Prescott 2006</a>, p. 473), here on the fifth front flyleaf and fol. 65v probably because the first and last folios are darker than the rest and the stamp would be hardly visible, are large square red stamps, reading 'MUSEUM BRITANNICUM' and dated to the eighteenth century. A smaller stamp with the words 'BRITISH MUSEUM' around a small crown, is placed in the margins throughout the manuscript (e.g. fols 8v, 26v, 32v). Notes on allocation on the top margin of fol. 1r the Harley shelfmarks '6258.b.' in dark brown ink and '2/III A' in pencil, the latter being also found on the endleaf of Harley 585, another medical manuscript because Harleian manuscripts were shelved according to subject classification in Montagu House. On the back of front cover, low left corner, '49.9.' is written in pencil.\n\n<a href=\"#dev838\">De Vriend</a> (1984, p. 62) suggests a later hand for the addition to <span class=\"italics\">torenijen</span> in the top margin of fol. 36r. The hand seems, however, the same but varies slightly in being a little less compressed, as in the annotation of the lower margin of fol. 32r.\n\nThe title of fol. 20r <span class=\"italics\">millefolio</span> added in the top margin is very similar to the main hand, but the colour is very black and <span class=\"italics\">millefolio</span> is added in the middle of the ninth cure of the chapter, thus suggesting that it may have been added later, perhaps after the loss of Quire 2 which contains the beginning of the chapter.",
    "binding": "<p> Outside leaves, front and back, are darker than the rest, suggesting that the manuscript was unbound for a long period. It has then been bound at least three times. </p><p><a href=\"#coc404\">Cockayne</a> (1866, I, p. lxxxv) mentioned the substitution of an earlier binding just after his publication of the manuscript, in 1866. The nineteenth-century binding is described as a small volume bound in brown leather; on the front and back covers, the coats of arms of the Harley family, gold-tooled; on the spine the title 'DE MEDICINIS HERBARIUM DE FERIS MEDICAMENTIS ETC. ANGLICE, MUS. BRIT. BIBL. HARL. 6258B PLUT.XLIX G.' (<a href=\"#dev839\">De Vriend 1972</a>, p. xxvii). </p><p>The shelfmark 'PLUT.XLIX.G' is also recorded on the last front leaf; it relates to the moving of the manuscripts from Montagu House into the Manuscripts Saloon in 1824 (see <a href=\"#pre408\">Prescott 2006</a>, p. 513). </p><p>The modern British Library binding is made of 3/4 red leather, the remainder being of textured red cloth with the Harley arms in gilt on the front and back covers. The title 'HERBAL BRIT. MUS. HARL. MS 6258B' is labelled on the spine. </p>", 
    "accompanying": "Added modern paper flyleaves at the beginning and end of the manuscript. The last three front leaves and first three endleaves are of slightly different paper and were very probably part of the earlier binding described by <a href=\"#dev838\">De Vriend 1972</a>.", 
    "history": {
        "origin": "Unknown.", 
        "provenance": "The manuscript belonged to the Harley collection and was probably acquired by <span class=\"name\">Edward Harley (1689-1741), 2nd earl of Oxford and Mortimer</span>, after the death of the librarian of the Harleian Collection <span class=\"name\">Humphrey Wanley</span> (1672-1726). It was in fact catalogued by the librarian <span class=\"name\">William Hocker</span> (see <a href=\"#wri851\">Wright and Wright 1966</a>, I, p. lxxxi; II, pp. 475-515).", 
        "acquisition": "The manuscript was sold with the other Harley manuscripts in 1753 to the nation under the Act of Parliament that also established the British Museum."
