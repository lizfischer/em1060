It includes items from <span class = \"name \" > Ælfric </span> 's first series of <span class = \"italics \" > Catholic Homilies </span> (fols 7v-12, 13-31), sermons and dedications and a version of the <span class = \"italics \" > Paternoster </span> and <span class = \"italics \" > Creed </span>: '[Ð]u ure fæder....sy hit swa. Ic gelyfe on god fæder almihtigne... ' (fol. 58r-v). Now bound with the revised version of the <span class = \"italics \" > Vita S.Dunstani </span> by 'B', s.xi <span class = \"sup \" > 1 </span>, and a chronicle attributed to Peter of Ickham. The manuscript, as it now exists, show signs of having been disordered at some point in its history. The sequencing of texts was disrupted when the manuscript came into the hands of sixteenth - century antiquarians, and it is still incorrectly sequenced.",

See <a href=\"#tre1587\">Treharne 2009</a> for more on this, including the bibliography on scribal practices at Exeter in the pontificate of <span class=\"name\">Leofric</span>; and <a href=\"#kat1650\">Kato 2012</a>. What appear to be five or more scribes in the descriptions of <a href=\"#ker44\">Ker 1957</a> and <a href=\"#dra419\">Drage 1978</a> are judged to be three or fewer in Treharne's analysis.
