Flyleaves fols i, ii, and 213 and 214 were added then. On the spine of the book, the title <span class=\"italics\">QVATVOR EVANGELIA</span> and the manuscript number 'Ii. 2. 11' are given in gold. </p><p> The previous binding, an elaborately tooled one made for <span class=\"name\">Archbishop Parker</span> in <span class=\"date_key\">1566</span>, is now kept separately. The leather is light brown, stamped in gold. The binding boards have the remains of two clasps, and the outer corners are covered with strips of metal. The board of the binding is about 6 mm thick, 224 mm x 334 mm. The horn label on the lower cover is inscribed <span class=\"italics\">Evangelia 4<span class=\"sup\">or</span> saxon.</span>, and the hand of this inscription is the same as the hand of inscription on the horn label of Ii. 2.11. The pastedown and the flyleaf of the upper cover were removed from the cover, and are now bound with the rest of the book as fols ix and x. They are from the sixteenth-century accounts: a vellum (fols ix<span class=\"sup\">r</span>-x<span class=\"sup\">v</span>) and a paper (fols ix<span class=\"sup\">v</span>-x<span class=\"sup\">r</span>) are pasted together. </p><p>The flyleaf of the lower cover of the previous binding is now kept with the old binding. The pastedown of the lower cover is still attached to the cover. </p><p> The seal of the Cambridge University Library is attached on <a href=\"../surrogates/CUL/Ii.2.11_fol.1r.htm\">fol. 1r</a>. </p><p> When the five leaves from the preliminary quire and three leaves from Quire 27 were cut and bound at the beginning of the <span class=\"italics\">Exeter Book</span> before the sixteenth century, some of the leaves were fastened together with strips of a fifteenth-century account-roll (See <span class=\"italics\">Exeter Book</span>, pp. 93-94). Three sets of leaves fastened together were: </p><ul>\n<li>Exeter now fols 6 and 7 (originally Quire 27, fol. 5 and Preliminary Quire, fol. 1)</li>\n<li>Exeter now fols 0 and 5 (originally Preliminary Quire, fol. 5 and Quire 27, fol. 3)</li>\n<li>Exeter now fols 1 and 4 (originally Preliminary Quire, fol. 2 and Quire 27, fol. 4)</li>\n</ul><p> Whoever fastened these leaves together probably did not know anything about the original make-up of the CUL Ii. 2. 11. The current Exeter fol. 1 contains <a href=\"#EM.CUL.Ii.2.11-msItem-3\">Item 3</a>. Part of the two-line high decorative letter has been hidden under the split of parchment. A later hand re-drew the letter 'H' in black ink. </p><p> These three strips of vellum have now been removed from these leaves, and bound separately in the <span class=\"italics\">Exeter Book</span>. </p>",
