In the case of the Gallicanum, interlinear space is 16 mm; x-height is 5 mm; ascenders and descenders 3 mm each. The measurements for the smaller columns are exactly half those of the Gallicanum. The gloss fills all the available interlinear space (with ascenders and descenders of 2mm, and an x-height of 1-1.5 mm).",
