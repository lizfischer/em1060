Its later medieval provenance is certainly <span class=\"name\">St Augustine's</span>. It was annotated extensively in s. xii by two hands, one of which wrote English notes in a <span class=\"name\">Kent</span>ish dialect on fols 4, 5v, 7v, 8v, 9-12, 14r, 15v, 16v, 17r, 19v, 34v, 40v, 44r, 51, 155v (<a href=\"#cra327\">Crawford</a> 1922) and a note on fol. 8r, 'Efter fyftene wintra; ˥ is súster chalmana' (<a href=\"#ang86\">Doane</a> 1998, p. 37). The same hand has added a few words to the main text, for example 'abrhames breþer' (fol. 39), '7 áne dohter' (fol. 80v) (<a href=\"#ker44\">Ker</a> 1957, p. 179).",

This s. xii < span class = \"sup \" > med < / span > scribe writes in a brownish ink in both Latin and English, and is generally very careful to avoid overwriting the illustrations; often, indeed, adhering to the ruling of the illustration frames, or preferring to write in the upper and lower margins.When necessary, though, the scribe will write within the frames themselves, adding explicatory text around and between the figures(such as fol. 7 v).As a result of the additions, pages that would have been filled with white space ( if such a description might be permitted), are now crowded in the manner of twelfth - century scholastic manuscripts.In the English additions, Ker states that 'the orthography is strange and dialectal forms are Kentish ' (<a href= \"#ker44 \">Ker 1957</a> p. 179), but this is not always the case, and there are many West Saxon forms.To the main text, the hand has added a large number of additional accents, usually acute, but c - shaped on 'god' and its case - forms, and on a few other short vowels.Similar c - shaped accents are found in < span class = \"name \" > Canterbury, Christ Church < / span > manuscripts, and books from < span class = \"name \" > Exeter < / span >.
