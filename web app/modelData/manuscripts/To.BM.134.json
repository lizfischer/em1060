The Old English is either in an English hand or has been carefully copied from an English exemplar: the occasional forms of one or two letters suggest that it is not impossibly in the same hand as the Latin\u2019. The manuscript was destroyed by fire in 1940, and <a href=\"#ker44\">Ker</a> (1957) described it from a reduced facsimile (P. Faider ad Jan P. van Sint, <span class=\"italics\">Catalogue des Manuscrits conserves \u00e0 Tournai</span> (1950)). Its place of production is not known.",
