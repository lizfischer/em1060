            <p>&#198;lfric's <span class="italics">Grammar and Glossary</span>, which 'shows a clear and unified structure' (<a href="#luc593">Lucas, 2008</a>). Copied in Exeter by five scribes (including the scribe who, according to <a href="#dra419">Drage</a>, worked very closely with <span class="name">Leofric</span>, bishop of Exeter 1050-72), all trained to write in Exeter style script. There are some alterations and glosses in French,
               Latin and English added to the text by contemporary and later hands. In the sixteenth century this manuscript was probably
               bound together with the Christ Church manuscript, <a href="BL.Domi.viii.htm">BL, Cotton, Domittian viii</a>, which now contains an Anglo-Saxon <span class="italics">Chronicle</span>.

            <p>Ker records a <span class="date_key">s. xviii</span> binding, uniform with that of <a href="CUL.Ii.1.33.htm#EM.CUL.Ii.1.33-bindingDesc.htm">Cambridge, CUL. Ii. 1. 33</a>. The present binding is of 1969 from the binding shop of <span class="name">Douglas Cockerell &amp; Son of Grantchester</span>, in incorporating the pastedown from an earlier binding, being a page from a <span class="date_key">s. xvi</span> printing of <span class="name">Paulus de Sancta Maria, bishop of Burgos</span>, <span class="italics">Scrutinum Scripturarum</span> (Paris, Anthonius Bonne Mere, colophon falsely dated 1472 but recte c. 1515), <span class="team"> {{
                  sig. M5r = fo. lxiii. Check the binding of the ms itself.
                  }} </span></p>
            	
            <p>There are double binding strips or guards around every quire, with leaf 8 of quire 1 and leaf 1 of quire 12 attached by them,
               while folios iii-vi occur in a single binding strip.

               	Marginalia in the hand of <span class="name">Robert Talbot</span> (d. <span class="date_key">1558</span>) show a special interest in place-names: his note on fol. 93v, 'Vide librum de legibus anglorum et danorum' refers probably to <a href="CCCC.383.htm">Cambridge, CCCC 383</a>, which he posses or at least used.
               	
            </p>
            	
            <p>Other marginalia are by <span class="name">Joscelyn</span>. See for example, the marginalia on fol. 11r where the larger hand is Talbot and the smaller one by Joscelyn.

         <ul><span class="itemHeading">Origin: </span>
                                    
            <p><a href="#ker196">Ker, and Watson, 1987</a> assigned it to s. xi Exeter on the grounds of scripts (p. 36).  <a href="#dra419">Drage</a> also agrees: 'Though not identifiable in the 1327 or 1506 inventories, it probably remained at Exeter until the sixteenth century.' (p. 338)
            </p>
                                
         </ul>
                             
         <ul><span class="itemHeading">Provenance: </span>
            
            <p>Ker's ascription to <span class="name">Christ Church, Canterbury</span> rests on the assumption that <a href="BL.Domi.viii.htm">Cotton Domitian viii</a> (fols 30-70) which is from that house, is the <span class="italics">Historia Angli&#230; Sax.</span>, which according to Parker's list of gifts to the university printed at the end of some copies of his <span class="italics">De antiquiate Britanniae ecclesiae Cantuariensis</span> in 1574, followed the <span class="italics">Grammar and Glossary</span>. 
               	
               
               	Both Cotton Domitian viii and CUL Hh. 1. 10 are annotated by <span class="name">Robert Talbot</span>. Parker, however, seems to have bound together manuscripts of different origins and provenance (for example,  CCCC MSS 190
               and 201. See <a href="#dra419">Drage</a>, p. 338), so this may have been the case too. 
                                   	According to Treharne,  other manuscripts of the <span class="italics">Grammar</span> can be localized to Canterbury (Durham, Cathedral B III. 32), and potentially Worcester (<a href="#tre106">'Producing A Library'</a>, p. 162).

            <p>The manuscript was also used by <span class="name">John Joscelyn</span> in <span class="date_key">s. xvi</span>.
