         <p>
            Incipit of the preface (Item 1; fol. 5r/3) shows that this copy is derived from one sent by <span class="name">Alfred</span> to <span class="name">Wulfsige</span> who was bishop of <span class="name">Sherborne</span> in the last decade of s. ix and who may be identical with <span class="name">Wulfsige</span> the successor of <span class="name">Heahstan</span>, bishop of <span class="name">London</span>, c. 900. It is followed by a metrical note (Item 2; fols 6v-7r) and by a list of the 65 chapters, numbered incorrectly I-LXIII (Item
            3; fols 7r-10r). The text begins on fol. 10v (Item 4), and ends imperfectly: the chapters in the text are not numbered.

                     initials are alternately red, blue, and green. Sometimes the scribe changed the line to begin the heading, but he always chose
                     to bite into the space for the next chapter, rather than having only one or two words. There is no white space between chapters.
                     The chapters are not numbered. The scribe sometimes began sentences with an emphasized (but not coloured) letters (for example,

            <p>There are, however, regular interlinear additions by the main hand. For example, 62r/14: <span class="add">to</span>; 64r/2: galet<span class="add">h</span>as; 88v/21: &#8257; <span class="add">man</span>; 104v/24: ge &#447;orh&#8257; <span class="add">t</span>; 108r/22: &#8257; <span class="add">un</span>; 88v/21: nan &#8257;<span class="add">man</span> mid; 101r/23: ge stru<span class="add">y</span>ne.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Methods of cancellation include both physical erasures and expunction. For physical erasure, see for example, 46v/12: <span class="del" title="physical erasure">&#447;</span><span class="add" title="overwritten">s</span>&#447;i&#240;e ('s' is overwritten); 111r/11: <span class="del" title="physical erasure">&#254;<span class="unclear">x</span></span><span class="add" title="overwritten">li</span>fes; 88r/20: h&#447;<span class="del" title="expunction">&#230;</span><span class="add" title="interlinear">e</span>ne; 94v/01 and 03: '<span class="del" title="expunction">tantalius</span>' and '<span class="del" title="expunction">syinblede</span>'.
               
            </p>
            	
            
            <p>Some cases of correction might be by a different hand, or the same scribe but at a later stage. For example,
               	<span class="locus">85r/09</span>: &#230;rest <span class="add" title="interlinear">ea&#447;f&#230;st</span>; <span class="locus">103v/21</span>: '<span class="del" title="underlined">&#254;uh</span> <span class="add" title="margin">&#254;urh</span>'; <span class="locus">117r/03</span>: '&#254;aland<span class="add" title="interlinear">hand</span>' (probably much later hand).
