     <p>This page contains the XML description template and the XSLT to transform the XML files into HTML pages, which we used in the catalogue for the project. </p>
     <p>We developed <a href="editorial.htm">two levels of description</a> and the stylesheets are contained in this architecture as follows:</p>
     <ul>
       <li><a href="../templates/EM_desc.xml" download="EM_desc.xml">Download XML Template</a>

     <h3 align="center"><a name="general">General information</a> </h3>
     <p> This section contains general information regarding the manuscript, to be used as a navigation tool to find and indexing manuscripts . </p>
     <ul>
       <li> Manuscript Identifier: a unique number to be attribute to each manuscript for ease of electronic search </li>
       <li> Repository: where the manuscript is kept </li>
       <li> Shelf mark or press mark </li>
       <li> Nickname: common name or popular name by which the manuscript is known to the scholarly community </li>
       <li> Title: it provide a standard short description of the content and date </li>
     </ul>
    <h3 align="center"><a name="pre">Pre-1220 content</a></h3>
     <p> In this section we include all those items which were inserted in the manuscript before 1220. We define &lsquo;ITEM&rsquo; as text which is written in main ruled frames or columns, or a text either outside the ruled margins or in an interlinear position. </p>
     <ul>
       <li>Summary: Summary information on the content of the text; a very brief overview.
       </li>
       <li>Item:
         <ul>
           <li> Indication of where the item appears: folio numbers for the beginning and end of the item, lines and columns. Note the difference in abbreviating fol. and fols, see <a rel="external" href="http://www.mhra.org.uk/Publications/Books/StyleGuide/index.html">MHRA Style Guide</a> p. 50. </li>
           <li> Example: fols 2r-24v8; fol. 3; fols 2-24v8a (<strong>a</strong> indicates the first column) </li>
           <li> If the item is not included in the main frame or column, we indicate in which margin it appears
               <ul>
                 <li> Example: fol. 25r3-18 right margin</li>
               </ul>
           </li>
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li> Modern title of work, if there a commonly-agreed one, such as &lsquo;Homily for the second Sunday after Epiphany&rsquo;, plus Cameron number. </li>
       <li> Rubrics: transcription<em>.</em></li>
       <li><em> Incipit</em> and <em>explicit</em>: We transcribe for each <em>incipit</em> and <em>explicit</em> a complete grammatical and semantic unit. The colophon, if present, is completely transcribed. </li>
       <li> Addition: indicates that the text is inserted either in the margin or in interlinear position or in a blank space. </li>
       <li> Note that Rubric, Incipit and Explicit and short Additions are transcribed.
         <p align="center"> TRANSCRIPTION GUIDELINES: </p>
         <ul>
           <li> Retain manuscript reading and word division; </li>
           <li> Manuscript punctuation should also be retained; </li>
           <li>&lt;&gt; indicates letters are supplied; </li>
           <li> [...]indicates letters are lost (Tag: &lt;unclear reason=&quot;trimming&quot;&gt;[...]&lt;/unclear&gt;); </li>
           <li> xx indicates unreadable for any reasons. Each x denotes the space of a single letter. </li>
           <li> / indicates line break (Tag: &lt;lb/&gt;); </li>
           <li> Abbreviations will be expanded. In the on-line version they will be italicised (Tag: &lt;expan&gt;&lt;/expan&gt;); </li>
           <li> Alterations if transcribed are tagged with &lt;add&gt;&lt;/add&gt;. It is possible to provide an explanation as to where the alteration is placed: &lt;add place=&quot;interlinear&quot;&gt;oi&lt;/add&gt;; </li>
           <li> Special fonts for wyn, &thorn;, &eth;, &aelig;, 7; &ETH;, &AElig;, &THORN; are used; </li>
           <li> Accents in incipit and explicit are transcribed; </li>
           <li> Use of capitals: rubrics--rustic capitals, square capitals, uncials, or a hybrid-- are transcribed in small capitals. Large capitals are used for labelling pen-drawn initials and for <em>litterae notabiliores</em>. <em>Litterae notabiliores</em> are any capitals that are offset in some way: by size, by decorative features, or by design, to make them visually more obvious than other graphs on the folio. </li>
           <li> Many manuscripts have two layers of rubric: the title in a larger capital, and then the first two or three lines of text - the incipit - in smaller caps. Using small caps for all rubrics and saving large caps for decorated initials makes the distinction clearer. </li>
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li> Language indicates the main language of the item. </li>
       <li>Other versions of the text: list all the manuscripts. We reference manuscripts by their short titles: CUL Ii.1.33; Bodley 343; CCCC 303; Vespasian D. xiv. </li>
       <li> Note: Avoid judgemental terms in relation to textual constitution and transmission; e.g., &lsquo;variant&rsquo;, &lsquo;authorial&rsquo;, &lsquo;authentic&rsquo;, &lsquo;corrupt&rsquo;, &lsquo;deviant&rsquo;, &lsquo;imperfect&rsquo;, &lsquo;presence/absence&rsquo;, &lsquo;deletion/addition&rsquo;. Use &lsquo;acephalous&rsquo; where folio(s) missing; use &lsquo;starts at&rsquo; otherwise. Try to match a note in the items (marginalia and interlineata) with a date. The date can be general, such as s.xiii. </li>
       <li> Bibliography: Reference to printed editions of published articles. Latest, scholarly editions are given: not Thorpe, but Clemoes if the text is available, since it is possible to cross-reference Thorpe through Clemoes. A comprehensive bibliographical note on the manuscript and all its items is in the general bibliography at the end of the manuscript description. </li>
